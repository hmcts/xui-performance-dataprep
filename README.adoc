### Data-prep script for XUI performance testing

To run locally:
- Performance test against the perftest environment: `./gradlew gatlingRun`


Before running locally, update the client secret in src/gatling/resources/application.conf then run `git update-index --assume-unchanged src/gatling/resources/application.conf` to ensure the changes aren't pushed to github.

To make other configuration changes to the file, first run `git update-index --no-assume-unchanged src/gatling/resources/application.conf`, ensuring to remove the client secret before pushing to origin
